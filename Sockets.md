# Socket Types
## User Space Sockets
Stream 

	attempts to build a session with TCP, STCP and Bluetooth

Datagram sockets

	connectionless, quickly send and receive, UDP


 The most common sockets that do not require elevated privileges to perform actions on behalf of user applications.
## Kernel Space Sockets
  RAW

    Direct sending and receiving of IP packets without automatic protocol-specific formatting.

Attempts to access hardware directly on behalf of a user application to either prevent encapsulation/decapsulation or to create packets from scratch, which requires elevated privileges.


 ## USER SPACE APPLICATIONS/SOCKETS

 Using tcpdump or wireshark to read a file

Using nmap with no switches

Using netcat to connect to a listener

Using netcat to create a listener above the well known port range (1024+)

Using /dev/tcp or /dev/udp to transmit data

## Kenrenl Space Apps/Sockets

Using tcpdump or wireshark to capture packets on the wire

Using nmap for OS identification or to set specific flags when scanning

Using netcat to create a listener in the well known port range (0 - 1023)

Using Scapy to craft or modify a packet for transmission

Using Python to craft or modify RAW Sockets for transmission

Network devices using routing protocols such as OSPF

Any Traffic without Transport Header (ICMP)

# Python Terms
## Libraries (Standard Python Library)

 Modules (_import module)

	Functions (module.function)

	Exceptions (try:)

	Constants (AF_INET)
	
	Objects ()

	List [] vs Tuple ()

## STRING VS INTEGER
String

	my_string = "Hello World"

Number

	int = 1234

	float = 3.14

	hex = 0x45

## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
	int()

	len()

	str()

	sum()

	print()


## BUILT-IN METHODS
	my_string.upper()

	my_string.lower()
	
	my_string.split()

	my_list.append()

	my_list.insert()


 ## How Imports Work

	import {module}

	import {module} as {name} (if you use a name that already exists you will overwrite previous name)

	from {module} import *

	from {module} import {function}

	from {module} import {function} as {name}
# NETWORK PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON3
![tcp-socket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f33e57f-e2d3-4346-9167-1220fc0a7e00)
ï¿¼
Network sockets primarily use the Python3 Socket library and socket.socket function.
```
import socket
  s = socket.socket(socket.FAMILY, socket.TYPE, socket.PROTOCOL)
```


## THE SOCKET.SOCKET FUNCTION
Inside the socket.socket. function, you have these arguments, in order:

	socket.socket( *family*, *type*, *proto* )
 
family: AF_INET*, AF_INET6, AF_UNIX

type: SOCK_STREAM*, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW

proto: 0*, IPPROTO_TCP, IPPROTO_UDP, IPPROTO_IP, IPPROTO_ICMP, IPPROTO_RAW

# STREAM AND DGRAM SOCKET DEMO

## DEMO Stream Socket
```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
ip_addr = '127.0.0.1'
port = 1111
s.connect((ip_addr, port))
message = b"Message"
s.send(message)
data, conn = s.recvfrom(1024)
print(data.decode('utf-8'))
s.close()
```

IP address and port
s.connect tells to connect what was specified

"b" designates a bytes like object to be sent, because it must be 

data, conn, will accept the connection and save it as a variable


## Stream Socket Receiver DEMO

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket
import os
port = 1111
message = b"Connected to TCP Server on port %i\n" % port
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
s.bind(('', port))
s.listen(1)
os.system("clear")
print ("Waiting for TCP connections\n")
while 1:
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    connect = conn.recv(1024)
    address, port = addr
    print ("Message Received - '%s'" % connect.decode())
    print ("Sent by -", address, "port -", port, "\n")
    conn.sendall(message)
    conn.close()

 ```

# Datagram Socket Sender 
DEMO (UDP)

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM, 0)
ip_addr = '127.0.0.1'
port = 2222
message = b"Message"
s.sendto(message, (ip_addr, port))
data, addr = s.recvfrom(1024)
print(data.decode())

```

 ## Datagram Socket Receiver


```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket

port = 2222
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM,0)
s.bind(('', port))
os.system("clear")
print ("Awaiting UDP Messages")
while True:
    data, addr = s.recvfrom(1024)
    address, port = addr
    print ("\nMessage Received: '%s'" % data.decode())
    print ("Sent by -", address, "port", port)
    s.sendto(b"Message received by the UDP Message Server!", addr)
```
 ### BONUS
-lup 

	specifies UDP listener
# RAW IPV4 SOCKETS


Must include;

	the Ip header 

 	Next Headers

Requires guidance from the "Request for Comments" (RFC) to follow header structure properly.

	RFCs contain technical and organizational documents about the Internet, including specifications and policy documents.

See RFC 791, Section 3 - Specification for details on how to construct an IPv4 header.


## RAW USES

	Testing specific defense mechanisms - such as triggering and IDS for an effect, or filtering

	Avoiding defense mechanisms(Can add a single CHAR to get past defenses)

	Obfuscating data during transfer

	Manually crafting a packet with the chosen data in header fields


# Encoding and Decoding


Encoding

	The process of taking bits and converting them using a specified cipher.

Decoding

	Reverse of the conversion process used by the specified cipher for encoding.

Common encoding schemes
	
	UTF-8, Base64, Hex

DOES NOT actually change value, just changes how its seen


# ENCODING VS ENCRYPTION
Encoding - converts data into a different format

Encryption - scrambles data to make it unreadable without a secret key


# HEX ENCODING AND DECODING
Encode text to Hex:

	echo "Message" | xxd
 
Encode file to Hex:

	xxd file.txt file-encoded.txt

Decode file from Hex:

	xxd -r file-encoded.txt file-decoded.txt

# PYTHON HEX ENCODING
```
import binascii
message = b'Message'
hidden_msg = binascii.hexlify(message)
```

# BASE64 ENCODING AND DECODING
Encode text to base64:

	echo "Message" | base64
 
Endode file to Base64:

	base64 file.txt > file-encoded.txt
 
Decode file from Base64:

	base64 -d file-encoded.txt > file-decoded.txt
